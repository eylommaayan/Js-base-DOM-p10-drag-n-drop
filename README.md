JavaScript for a drag-and-drop functionality


dragStart: When the drag operation starts, it adds the class 'hold' to the element being dragged and sets a timeout to change its class to 'invisible'. This is likely to give a visual cue that the element is being dragged.
dragEnd: When the drag operation ends, it resets the class of the element to 'fill'.
dragOver: This function is called when an element is being dragged over a valid drop target. It prevents the default behavior, allowing a drop.
dragEnter: When the dragged element enters a valid drop target, it adds the class 'hovered' to provide a visual cue.
dragLeave: When the dragged element leaves a drop target, it removes the 'hovered' class.
dragDrop: This function is called when the element is dropped onto a valid drop target. It resets the class of the drop target to 'empty' and appends the dragged element to it.
Overall, this code sets up the basic functionality for a drag-and-drop interaction between elements with the specified classes.
